This branch contains the boundary element code which I’m using to solve nonlocal electrostatic problem for singe ion.You should run loadconstant.m before anything.in order to solve the nonlocal problem, you should run solveEnergyNonlocal.m.The input arguments for this function are:pqrFile: path to pqrfile in your local machine (Rad5.pqr is an example for the sphere of 5 Angstrom radius)srfFile: surface file generated by msms (some examples are included in “/geometry/protsphere”)E_0: permittivity of free spaceE_inf: short range dielectric constant E_omega: dielectric constant of proteinE_sigma: dieletric constant of bulk waterkappa: inverse Debye screening length If you change folder to “supp/matlab” and run the below script in the command line, it will solve the problem for single sphere of radius 5 Angstroms and central charge of 1e in water. You will get the salvation energy (E_transfer) along with single layer and double layer matrix operators (A), Dirichlet and Neumann trace (B), Yukawa operators (A_Y) and some useful data about other operators.[E_transfer,A,B,C,A_Y,A_nl,B_nl,C_nl,V1,K1,VY1,KY1]=solvEnergyNonlocal('Rad5.pqr','../geometry/protsphere/density25.srf',E_0,1.8,1,80,1);
